# LibCECService

## Description
A Windows Service that can control a LibCEC Adapter through Service Commands.

## Why
I wanted to automate my media station as much as I could, and the CEC Adapter was the last puzzle piece to accomplish this. A combination of this, Display Fusion and Controller Companion I can finally control everything without moving a bit, now that's worth living for.

## Requirements
- [Pulse-Eight USB-CEC Adapter](https://www.pulse-eight.com/p/104/usb-hdmi-cec-adapter)
- [USB CEC Adapter Communication Library](https://github.com/Pulse-Eight/libcec)

## Usage
- Control your CEC Adapter from everywhere.
- Combine this with Display Fusion and create your own custom behaviour.
- Use your immagination.

## Example
